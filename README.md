# ProductManager

To begin, clone to a local folder of your choice and use command `npm install`

## Run Local Development Server

Run `npm run start` to serve and open browser.

## Run Json Server (As Local DB)
Use command `npm run json-run`. This is a functional local database, so edits and deletes will change the data.

## Other Libraries
I chose Angular Material Design for the frontend UI library.
